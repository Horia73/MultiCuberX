# MultiCuberX
A lego robot that can solve 3x3x3, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 Rubik's Cubes
It all started 3 years ago when I saw the CraneCuber:
https://github.com/dwalton76/lego-crane-cuber

So I decided to make something like that but with stepper motors and here we are.

For now, image analisys it's done with rubiksk-cube-tracker, rubiks-color-resolver and the solution is provided by rubiks-cube-NxNxN-solver. The links are available at the CraneCuber repository. I added all the software into this repository because in this way will be able to run on windows immediatly after cloning.
